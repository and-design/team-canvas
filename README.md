# Team Canvas Basic
## Objective
Team Canvas Basic is a strategic framework that helps team members to kick off projects and align on common vision. Based on our experience with startups and creative groups, it is made to smoothly start collective projects, let people learn about each other and accumulate enough momentum to get going.

Team Canvas Basic works best at the following touchpoints:

- creating a team;
- kicking off a project;
- welcoming new team member (e.g. freelancer joining the team);
- basic team alignment meeting.

## Onboarding team members
It's a good idea to get team members on board before using Team Canvas Basic. Here are few ideas of how you might introduce the framework:

**Starting a team**
Hey guys! We're starting a team and many of us have never worked with each other before. I've come across this handy tool, Team Canvas Basic, that helps team members to learn most basic things about each other and get aligned on their goals and expectations. The meeting should take about half an hour. Should we try it out?

**Welcoming a team member**
Hey guys, we have Marie joining the team this week. I thought it might be useful for all of us to take Marie into details with a short Team Canvas session, so we all are on the same page about our goals, roles and team culture. What do you think?

**Basic team alignment**
Hey guys! I was thinking that we could spend some time to structure the way we work together. There is a good tool for that called Team Canvas. It might help us understand what we do and why, where we aim at and what our guiding principles are, so we are more aligned as a team. What would you say if we schedule half an hour meeting to quickly go through Team Canvas steps?
